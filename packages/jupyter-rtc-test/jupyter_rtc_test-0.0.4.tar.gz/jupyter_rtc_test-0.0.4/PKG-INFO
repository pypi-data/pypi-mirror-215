# Jupyter RTC Test

> 📶 Stress tests for 🪐 Jupyter 🔌 Real Time Collaboration (RTC).

The goal of this repository is to stress test the Real Time Collaboration (RTC) feature of JupyterLab and Jupyter Server and is a needed requirement [to avoid users having issues when they enable RTC](./docs/why.md).

The current list of discovered issues is [maintained on this page](./docs/issues.md).

The tests aims to replicate real life cases, meaning that most of them are running in a distrbuted way. You can run the test on a standalone (local laptop or CI) machine, in which case the distributed behavior is simulated.

You can also run the tests in a real a distributed environment like Kubernetes, this however requires you to setup additional infrastructure and configuration. Please note you can also run the Kubernetes flavored tests on a local Minikube instance.

## Install

[Install](./docs/install.md) the tool directly from PyPI and [launch it](./docs/use.md) from the command line.

## Develop

Setup your [environment](./docs/environment.md) to run the [tests](./docs/tests.md).

You can also use the [user interfaces](./docs/ui.md) if you prefer.
