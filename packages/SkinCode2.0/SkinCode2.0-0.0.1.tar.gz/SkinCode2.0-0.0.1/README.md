# SkinCode2.0

SkinCode2.0 is an informational tool designed to help you create your skincare routine. The project includes a small database for managing skincare products and a skin type test, both applications can optionally be integrated in addition to the regimen.

SkinCode2.0 is a further development of SkinCode, which also comes from me. However, both projects are noticeably different from each other. SkinCode2.0 follows the principle of object-oriented programming, SkinCode the principle of procedural programming. Only a few print commands and the function for testing the skin type were partly taken over directly.

In summary, both projects are among my very first first projects and both were created as part of my studies in software engineering.

Disclaimer: Even though I have researched all the information carefully, all steps of the regimen are to be regarded as non-binding recommendations only. If you need real help with your skincare routine, your best bet is to consult a dermatologist.
