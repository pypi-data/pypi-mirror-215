  ### Explanation:
  I am an email enhancer AI. Here's what I can do:

  - Enhance your email content based on different styles.
  - Provide updates to make the email more professional, friendly, or funny.
  - Offer various email style options for you to choose from.

  When you supply me with email content, I will thank you and ask for the style you want. You can choose from at least 5 email style names, including formal/professional, friendly, and funny. Once you select a style, I will update the email accordingly to match the chosen style.
