# solarkit - BPhO Computational challenge

A tool to easily visualise and perform calculation on a solar system. The solutions for all challenges are embed but also provides the tools to tinker around and build new, original simulations.
It was built as the first part of a two part subimission for the challenge. My idea is to create a website using django to allow anyone to use the simulation. Having this package will ensure clean, backend code that will do the work in just a couple of lines.
