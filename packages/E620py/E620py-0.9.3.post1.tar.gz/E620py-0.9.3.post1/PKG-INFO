# E620py

E620py is a python library for interacting with the e621 api.

Here is an example of fetching a single post:
```python
>>> import e620py
>>> post = e620py.E6get().post_get("order:score", fetch_all=False, fetch_count=1)
>>> print(post[0].m_id)
2848682
```
Most functions have doc strings so its easy to quickly see how a function works without having to understand the spaghetti code 💀.
