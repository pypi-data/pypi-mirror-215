pipv_1.run("test.py venv_test1")
pipv_1.delete_venv()

# Run in venv2
with PipControl(__file__, venv_folder="venv2") as pipv_2:
    pipv_2.setup_venv()  # Same as venv = True
    pipv_2.install(packages)  # Same as packages=packages,
    pipv_2.run("test.py venv_test2")  # Same as file_name="test.py venv_test2",

# Run in venv3
with PipControl(__file__, packages, "test.py venv_test3", "venv3", True) as pipv_3:
