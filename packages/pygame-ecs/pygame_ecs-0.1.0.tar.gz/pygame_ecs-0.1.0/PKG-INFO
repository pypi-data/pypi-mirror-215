# pyg-ecs

An simple ECS library built for pygame
Not finished rn, in development

# Architecture

Entities are just stored as int's for their id's
components are stored in as lists in a dictionary, keys are entity id's and values are component lists.

# Notes

You shouldn't use this for a game with a lot of entities and components, but it's fine for small games and testing.

# todo:

Update the `download_url` found in `setup.py`
