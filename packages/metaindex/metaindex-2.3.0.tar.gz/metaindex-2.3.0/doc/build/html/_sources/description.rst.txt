With *metaindex* you can index and find files on your disk based on their
metadata, like the title of a PDF, the keywords of an ebook, or the model
of a camera that a photo was taken with.

The following types of files are supported by default:

 - Images (anything that has EXIF, IPTC, or XMP information),
 - Audio (audio file formats that have ID3 header or similar),
 - Video (most video file formats have an ID3 header),
 - PDF,
 - ebooks (epub natively, calibre metadata files are understood, too),
 - ABC notation.

More file types can be supported through the use of Addons.

User provided extra metadata is supported, if itâ€™s provided in the same
directory as the file and the metadata file is ``.metadata.json``.
