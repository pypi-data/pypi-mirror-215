# KNX UI

This is the KNX panel for the KNX core integration in Home Assistant. It provides a user interface for interacting with the
KNX integration.

## Features

* Get an overview of your current KNX installation state (shows if connected to the Bus, which XKNX version is running and the currently assigned Individual address)
* Use the interactive bus monitor to view all incoming and outgoing telegrams on the bus
