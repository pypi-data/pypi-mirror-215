# Python eVatR Client
A Python client for simple and qualified VAT-number validations. 

This is a Python port of the Typescript client that can be found here: [eVatR Typescript Client](https://github.com/qqilihq/evatr/tree/master)

You can find detailed information on the underlying API here (German): https://evatr.bff-online.de/eVatR/xmlrpc/

Users need to provide a registered German VAT-number (Umsatzsteuer-Identifikationsnummern) to use this client.

This tool is not endorsed by the "Bundeszentralamt für Steuern".

## Usage
```python
from evatr_client import EvatrClient, ISimpleParams, IQualifiedParams

client = EvatrClient()

simpleParams: ISimpleParams = ISimpleParams(include_raw_xml=False,
                                                own_vat_number='<your own VAT number>', 
                                                validate_vat_number='<the VAT number to validate>')

client.check_simple(simpleParams)

qualifiedParams: IQualifiedParams = IQualifiedParams(include_raw_xml=False,
                                                own_vat_number='<your own VAT number>', 
                                                validate_vat_number='<the VAT number to validate>', 
                                                company_name='<SomeCompany Srl>', 
                                                city='Milano',
