# _OCP CAD Viewer_ for VS Code

_OCP CAD Viewer_ for VS Code is an extension to show [CadQuery](https://github.com/cadquery/cadquery) and [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d) objects in VS Code via the [three-cad-viewer](https://github.com/bernhard-42/three-cad-viewer) viewer component.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   A fairly recent version of Microsoft VS Code, e.g. 1.76.0 or newer
-   The [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) installed in VS Code
-   `python` and `pip` available in the Python enviroment that will be used for CAD development
-   The command `git` needs to be available
-   On a Silicon Apple computer `mamba`

**Notes**:

-   For VSCodium, the extension is not available in the VS code market place. You need to download the the vsix file from the [release folder](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer/releases) and install it manually.
-   Currently, on a Silicon Mac (ARM CPU), _OCP_ and _CadQuery_ can only be installed via `mamba` and Python 3.9 or 3.10. Prepare an environment with `mamba create -n code_cad python=3.9` or `mamba create -n code_cad python=3.10`.
-   **BREAKING CHANGES**:
    -   IPython and the ipython extensions are not supported any more out of the box. Instead the Microsoft's Jupyter extension with ipykernel is supported. If you have the installation configs in your local VS Code settings.json file, you might want to remove the ipython installation commands.
    -   For the color maps, `CM` is replaced by `ColorMap` (to resolve the conflict with build123d `CM`)

### Installation

1. Open the VS Code Marketplace, and search and install _OCP CAD Viewer 1.1.2_.

    Afterwards the OCP viewer is available in the VS Code sidebar:

2. Clicking on it shows the OCP CAD Viewer UI:

    You have 3 options:

    -   Prepare _OCP CAD Viewer_ for working with [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d): Presse the _Quickstart build123d_ button.

        This will install _OCP_, _build123d_, _ipykernel_ (_jupyter_client_), _ocp_tessellate_ and _ocp_vscode_ via `pip` (except for Apple Silicon machines that require `mamba`)

    -   Prepare _OCP CAD Viewer_ for working with [CadQuery](https://github.com/cadquery/cadquery): Presse the _Quickstart CadQuery_ button.

        This will install _OCP_, _CadQuery_, _ipykernel_ (_jupyter_client_), _ocp_tessellate_ and _ocp_vscode_ via `pip` (except for Apple Silicon machines that require `mamba`)

    -   Ignore the quick starts and use the "Library Manager" to install the libraries. Doing so, _OCP CAD Viewer_ let's you select whether to use `pip`, `mamba`, `conda` or `poetry`. Install the needed library by pressing the green down-arrow behind the library name in the "Library Manager" section of the _OCP CAD Viewer_ sidebar. For more details, see [here](./docs/install.md)

    The Quickstarts will also

    -   (optionally) install the the [Jupyter extension for VS Code from Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
    -   start the OCP viewer
    -   create a demo file in a temporary folder to quickly see a simple usage example


## Usage

### Running code using Jupyter

-   Start the _OCP CAD Viewer_ by pressing the green box-arrow button in the "Viewer Manager" section of the _OCP CAD Viewer_ sidebar
-   Import ocp_vscode and the CAD library by using the paste button behing the library names in the "Viewer Manager" section
-   Use the usual Run menu to run the code

### Debugging code with visual debugging

After each step, the debugger checks all variables in `locals()` for being CAD objects and displays them with their variable name.
Note:

-   Check that `OCP: on` is visible in the status bar
-   It also shows planes, locations and axis, so name your contexts
-   It remembers camera position and unselected variables in the tree
-   during debugging, `show` and `show_object` are disabled. They interfere with the visual debugging

### Library Manager

You can also use "Library Manager" in the _OCP CAD Viewer_ sidebar to manage the Python libraries for _build123d_, _cadquery_, _ipython_ and _ocp_tessellate_ (Presse the green arrow whenhovering over a library to install/upgrade it)
