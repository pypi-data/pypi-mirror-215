class Performative(enum.Enum):
    """
    Performatives available as defined in http://www.fipa.org/specs/fipa00037/.

    These performatives are intended to be used with :class:`ACLMessage`. Here is
    a small summary of what each performative means:

    **ACCEPT_PROPOSAL**
        The action of accepting a previously submitted proposal to perform an action.
    **AGREE**
        The action of agreeing to perform some action, possibly in the future.
    **CANCEL**
        The action of one agent informing another agent that the first agent no longer
        has the intention that the second agent perform some action.
    **CFP**
        The action of calling for proposals to perform a given action.
    **CONFIRM**
        The sender informs the receiver that a given proposition is true, where the
        receiver is known to be uncertain about the proposition.
    **DISCONFIRM**
        The sender informs the receiver that a given proposition is false, where the
        receiver is known to believe, or believe it likely that, the proposition is
        true.
    **FAILURE**
        The action of telling another agent that an action was attempted but the
        attempt failed.
    **INFORM**
        The sender informs the receiver that a given proposition is true.
    **INFORM_IF**
        A macro action for the agent of the action to inform the recipient whether or
        not a proposition is true.
    **INFORM_REF**
        A macro action for sender to inform the receiver the object which corresponds
        to a descriptor, for example, a name.
    **NOT_UNDERSTOOD**
        The sender of the act (for example, i) informs the receiver (for example, j)
        that it perceived that j performed some action, but that i did not understand
        what j just did. A particular common case is that i tells j that i did not
        understand the message that j has just sent to i.
    **PROPAGATE**
        The sender intends that the receiver treat the embedded message as sent
        directly to the receiver, and wants the receiver to identify the agents denoted
        by the given descriptor and send the received propagate message to them.
    **PROPOSE**
        The action of submitting a proposal to perform a certain action, given certain
        preconditions.
    **PROXY**
        The sender wants the receiver to select target agents denoted by a given
        description and to send an embedded message to them.
    **QUERY_IF**
        The action of asking another agent whether or not a given proposition is true.
    **QUERY_REF**
        The action of asking another agent for the object referred to by a referential
        expression.
    **REFUSE**
        The action of refusing to perform a given action, and explaining the reason for
        the refusal.
    **REJECT_PROPOSAL**
        The action of rejecting a proposal to perform some action during a negotiation.
    **REQUEST**
        The sender requests the receiver to perform some action. One important class of
        uses of the request act is to request the receiver to perform another
        communicative act.
    **REQUEST_WHEN**
        The sender wants the receiver to perform some action when some given
        proposition becomes true.
    **REQUEST_WHENEVER**
        The sender wants the receiver to perform some action as soon as some
        proposition becomes true and thereafter each time the proposition becomes true
        again.
    **SUBSCRIBE**
        The act of requesting a persistent intention to notify the sender of the value
        of a reference, and to notify again whenever the object identified by the
        reference changes.
