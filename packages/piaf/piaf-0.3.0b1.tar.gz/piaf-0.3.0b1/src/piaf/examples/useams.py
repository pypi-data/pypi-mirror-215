"""
A small program testing the AMS capabilities.

The scenario is the following:

1. Ten receiving agents and one broadcaster are created
2. The broadcaster one perform a request to find active agents
3. It sends a `Hello World` message to inform agents of its presence
4. The receiving agents display the message

It is possible that not all agents receives the message, since the broadcaster dies just after having sent its message
to at least one active agent. So, if some receivers where not ready at the time the broadcaster queried the AMS, those
agents won't receive the message.
