## ☕️ About
**Pulsars** (pronounced "Pulsar") is a system for helping researchers and engineers to **practically** use [Machine Learning (ML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [Deep Learning (DL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) algorithms.


**Pulsars** is based on **configuration files** and **CLI**. In other words, it takes an **input configuration file** in the [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) format with a **domain specific semantics** and generate **automatically** the associated python code.
In that way, the user only write (or use template) **configurations files** and run the whole system through the **CLI**.

Thus, the user can focus on the problem without to manage the **cumberstone stuff** and **complex python codes**, generally involved for building and training ML/DL models.


## ⁉️ Why
Because at first, researchers and engineers are not necessary **Python programmers** or **ML specialists**. 
In addition, even for **specialists**, we want to bring a different way of building such complex systems with **productivity** in minds.

## Built on the Python ecosystem

We do not want to **reinvent the wheel**, that's why **Pulsars** is built upon **Python ML/DL ecosystem**.

## ⚠️ Under construction
This project is at the **early developement stage** and is truly **experimental**.
This mean **most** of the features are **missing** and the documentation is still **lacking**.
The project **github** repository will be available soon ! Stay tuned !
After the public release of the github repository, contributions of any kinds (code, documentation, website, community ...) will be really welcome !😁
