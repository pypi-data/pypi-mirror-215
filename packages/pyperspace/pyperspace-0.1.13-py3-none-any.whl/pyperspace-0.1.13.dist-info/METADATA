Pyperspace is a time series database server written purely in Python and based on an LSM tree model for storage.

Pyperspace can be run either by the frontend "pyperspaced" and a configuration file, or as an embedded daemon in any Python application.  Designed for high-throughput and low-latency, Pyperspace utilizes a hybrid in-memory and on-disk storage engine that spawns subworkers to merge and compact disk contents whenever necessary and to avoid thread contention with concurrent clients reading and writing.

Because Pyperspace uses an LSM tree model, files are periodically merged and may result in higher disk utilization.  Configuration can be tuned based on performance and storage preferences.
