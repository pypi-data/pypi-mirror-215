## Project philosophy
- **Open source** - the project is open source and free to use. We are building the open platform for devs to tinker with and build their personal code-generation toolbox.
- **Clone yourself** - the project is about creating a clone of yourself. You can use it to automate your work, or to create a digital version of yourself that can speak for you.

## Setup

## Features
You can specify the "identity" of the AI agent by editing the files in the `identity` folder.

Editing the identity, and evolving the `memory` of the AI agent will change the way it responds to you.
