        """
        Computes a local extremum of the model by optimizing
        the equivalent Ising model using the Simulated
        Simulated Bifurcation (SB) algorithm. 

        The Simulated Bifurcation (SB) algorithm relies on
        Hamiltonian/quantum mechanics to find local minima of
        Ising problems. The spins dynamics is simulated using
        a first order symplectic integrator.

        There are different version of the SB algorithm:
        - the ballistic Simulated Bifurcation (bSB) which uses the particles'
        position for the matrix computations (usually slower but more accurate)
        - the discrete Simulated Bifurcation (dSB) which uses the particles'
        spin for the matrix computations (usually faster but less accurate)
        - the Heated ballistic Simulated Bifurcation (HbSB) which uses the bSB
        algorithm with a supplementary non-symplectic term to refine the model
        - the Heated ballistic Simulated Bifurcation (HdSB) which uses the dSB
        algorithm with a supplementary non-symplectic term to refine the model

        To stop the iterations of the symplectic integrator, a number of maximum
        steps needs to be specified. However a refined way to stop is also possible
        using a window that checks that the spins have not changed among a set
        number of previous steps. In practice, a every fixed number of steps
        (called a sampling period) the current spins will be compared to the
        previous ones. If they remain constant throughout a certain number of
        consecutive samplings (called the convergence threshold), the spins are
        considered to have bifurcated and the algorithm stops.

        Finally, it is possible to make several particle vectors at the same
        time (each one being called an agent). As the vectors are randomly
        initialized, using several agents helps exploring the solution space
        and increases the probability of finding a better solution, though it
        also slightly increases the computation time. In the end, only the best
        spin vector (energy-wise) is kept and used as the new Ising model's
        ground state.
