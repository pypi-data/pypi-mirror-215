# OpenSSM - Small Specialist Models

OpenSSM (pronounced `open-sesame`) is an open-source initiative committed to creating, sharing, and promoting Small Specialist Models (SSMs) for industrial and domain-specific AI applications.

Unlike Large Language Models (LLMs), which are computationally intensive and generalized, SSMs are lean, efficient, and designed specifically for individual domains. This focus makes them an optimal choice for businesses, SMEs, researchers, and developers seeking specialized and robust AI solutions for industrial applications.

A prime deployment scenario for SSMs is within the aiCALM (Collaborative Augmented Large Models) architecture. aiCALM represents a cohesive assembly of AI components tailored for sophisticated problem-solving capabilities. Within this framework, SSMs work with General Management Models (GMMs) and other components to solve complex, domain-specific, and industrial problems.

## Why OpenSSM?

- **Industrial Focus:** SSMs are developed with a specific emphasis on industrial applications, addressing the unique requirements of robustness, reliability, and scalability inherent to this sector.

- **Efficient and Fast:** SSMs are 100-1000x faster and more efficient than LLMs, making AI accessible and cost-effective, particularly for industrial usage where time and resources are critical factors.

- **Domain-Specific Knowledge:** Each SSM is finely-tuned to have expertise in a particular field, offering precise and specialized solutions, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and reliability of industrial AI applications.

- **Independence:** OpenSSM empowers businesses to build, train, and deploy their own AI models, reducing dependencies on large vendors and enhancing the robustness and control over their AI solutions.

- **Collaboration:** Multiple SSMs can be combined together, as in the aiCALM architecture, to solve complex, domain-specific, and industrial problems, endorsing a collaborative and robust approach to AI.

## Target Audience

Our primary audience includes:

- **Businesses and SMEs** wishing to leverage AI in their specific industrial context without relying on extensive computational resources or large vendor solutions.

- **AI researchers and developers** keen on creating more efficient, robust, and domain-specific AI models for industrial applications.

- **Open-source contributors** believing in democratizing industrial AI and eager to contribute to a community-driven project focused on building and sharing specialized AI models.

- **Industries** with specific domain problems that can be tackled more effectively by a specialist AI model, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI solutions in an industrial setting.
