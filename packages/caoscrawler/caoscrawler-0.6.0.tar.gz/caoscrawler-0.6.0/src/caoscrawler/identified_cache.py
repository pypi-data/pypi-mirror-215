    """
    This class is like a dictionary where the keys are Identifiables. When you check whether an
    Identifiable exists as key this class returns True not only if that exact Python object is
    used as a key, but if an Identifiable is used as key that is **equal** to the one being
    considered (see __eq__ function of Identifiable). Similarly, if you do `cache[identifiable]`
    you get the Record where the key is an Identifiable that is equal to the one in the rectangular
    brackets.

    This class is used for Records where we checked the existence in a remote server using
    identifiables. If the Record was found, this means that we identified the corresponding Record
    in the remote server and the ID of the local object can be set.
    To prevent querying the server again and again for the same objects, this cache allows storing
    Records that were found on a remote server and those that were not (typically in separate
    caches).
