# UDL (Make Available on PyPI :tada:)

UDL is a unified pytorch framework for vision research:

* UDL has faster library loading speed and more convenient reflection mechanism to call different models and methods.
* UDL is based on MMCV which provides the following functionalities.
* UDL is based on NNI to peform automatic machine learning.




[English](https://github.com/XiaoXiao-Woo/UDL/edit/dev/README.md) | [简体中文](https://github.com/XiaoXiao-Woo/UDL/edit/dev/README_zh.md)

See the [repo](https://github.com/liangjiandeng/PanCollection) for more detailed descriptions. 

## Note

For the implementation of DCFNet as described in the ICCV paper "Dynamic Cross Feature Fusion for Remote Sensing Pansharpening," please refer to the [branch](https://github.com/XiaoXiao-Woo/UDL/blob/UDL_DCFNet) in the this repository.

## Requirements
* Python3.7+, Pytorch>=1.6.0
* NVIDIA GPU + CUDA
* Run `python setup.py develop`

Note: Our project is based on MMCV, but you needn't to install it currently.

## Quick Start

> pip install -i udl-vis https://pypi.org/simple

### Quick Start for developer

**Step0.** We use UDL in PanCollection, first please set your Python environment.

>git clone https://github.com/XiaoXiao-Woo/UDL
> 
> git clone https://github.com/XiaoXiao-Woo/PanCollection

Then, 

> python setup.py develop


## Plannings

Please expect more tasks and models

- [x] [pansharpening](https://github.com/XiaoXiao-Woo/PanCollection)
  - [x] models

- [x] [derain](https://github.com/XiaoXiao-Woo/derain) (not available on PyPI)
  - [x] models

- [ ] HISR
  - [ ] models
 
 - [ ] Improve MMCV repo to simplify expensive hooks.

## Contribution
We appreciate all contributions to improving PanCollection. Looking forward to your contribution to PanCollection.
