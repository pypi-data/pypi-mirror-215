# UDL

UDL is a unified pytorch framework for vision research:

* UDL has faster library loading speed and more convenient reflection mechanism to call different models and methods.
* UDL is based on MMCV which provides the following functionalities.
* UDL is based on NNI to peform automatic machine learning.

See the [repo](https://github.com/liangjiandeng/PanCollection) for more detailed descriptions. 
## Features


## Requirements
* Python3.7+, Pytorch>=1.6.0
* NVIDIA GPU + CUDA
* Run `python setup.py develop`

Note: Our project is based on MMCV, but you needn't to install it currently.

## Quick Start
**Step0.** We use UDL in PanCollection, first please set your Python environment.

>git clone https://github.com/XiaoXiao-Woo/UDL
> 
> git clone https://github.com/XiaoXiao-Woo/PanCollection

Then, 

> python setup.py develop

or

> pip install -i udl-vis https://pypi.org/simple

**Step1.**
* Download datasets (WorldView-3, QuickBird, GaoFen2, WorldView2) from the [homepage](https://liangjiandeng.github.io/PanCollection.html). Put it with the following format. 

* Verify the dataset path in `PanCollection/UDL/Basis/option.py`, or you can print the output of `run_pansharpening.py`, then set __cfg.data_dir__ to your dataset path.

```
|-$ROOT/Datasets
├── pansharpening
│   ├── training_data
│   │   ├── train_wv3.h5
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── validation_data
│   │   │   ├── valid_wv3.h5
│   │   │   ├── ...
│   ├── test_data
│   │   ├── WV3
│   │   │   ├── test_wv3_multiExm.h5
│   │   │   ├── ...
```

**Step2.** Open `PanCollection/UDL/pansharpening`,  run the following code:

> python run_pansharpening.py

**step3.** How to train/validate the code.

* A training example：

	run_pansharpening.py
  
	where arch='BDPN', and configs/option_bdpn.py has: 
  
	__cfg.eval__ = False, 
  
	__cfg.workflow__ = [('train', 50), ('val', 1)], __cfg.dataset__ = {'train': 'wv3', 'val': 'wv3_multiExm.h5'}
	
* A test example:

	run_test_pansharpening.py
  
	__cfg.eval__ = True or __cfg.workflow__ = [('val', 1)]

**Step4**. How to customize the code.

One model is divided into three parts:

1. Record hyperparameter configurations in folder of `PanCollection/UDL/pansharpening/configs/option_<modelName>.py`. For example, you can load pretrained model by setting __model_path__ = "your_model_path" or __cfg.resume_from__ = "your_model_path".

2. Set model, loss, optimizer, scheduler in folder of `PanCollection/UDL/pansharpening/models/<modelName>_main.py`.

3. Write a new model in folder of `PanCollection/UDL/pansharpening/models/<modelName>/model_<modelName>.py`.

Note that when you add a new model into PanCollection, you need to update `PanCollection/UDL/pansharpening/models/__init__.py` and add option_<modelName>.py.

**Others**
* if you want to add customized datasets, you need to update:

```
PanCollection/UDL/AutoDL/__init__.py.
PanCollection/UDL/pansharpening/common/psdata.py.
```

* if you want to add customized tasks, you need to update:

```
1.Put model_<newModelName> and <newModelName>_main in PanCollection/UDL/<taskName>/models.
2.Create a new folder of PanCollection/UDL/<taskName>/configs to put option_<newModelName>.
3.Update PanCollection/UDL/AutoDL/__init__.
4.Add a class in PanCollection/UDL/Basis/python_sub_class.py, like this:
class PanSharpeningModel(ModelDispatcher, name='pansharpening'):
```

* if you want to add customized training settings, such as saving model, recording logs, and so on. you need to update:

```
PanCollection/UDL/mmcv/mmcv/runner/hooks
```

Note that: Don't put model/dataset/task-related files into the folder of AutoDL.

* if you want to know more details of runner about how to train/test in `PanCollection/UDL/AutoDL/trainer.py`, please see PanCollection/UDL/mmcv/mmcv/runner/epoch_based_runner.py
