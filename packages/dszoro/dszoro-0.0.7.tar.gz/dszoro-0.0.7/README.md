dszoro is a comprehensive Python package that provides a wide range of algorithms and data structures to help you master the art of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Whether you are a beginner exploring the fundamentals or an experienced developer aiming to optimize your code, dszoro has got you covered!

## Features

- **Data Structures:** dszoro offers a rich collection of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, graphs, and more. Each data structure is implemented with efficiency and ease of use in mind, allowing you to focus on solving problems rather than worrying about implementation details.

- **Algorithms:** Unlock the power of algorithms with dszoro. The package includes a variety of classic algorithms, including sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort), searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search), graph algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search, depth-first search), and much more. Whether you need to solve a specific problem or want to explore different algorithmic approaches, dszoro has the algorithms you need.

- **Visualization:** Visualizing data structures and algorithms can greatly enhance your understanding. dszoro provides intuitive visualization capabilities that enable you to see the inner workings of various data structures and algorithms. Dive deep into the process, step by step, and gain valuable insights into how things work under the hood.

- **Code Snippets and Examples:** The dszoro package comes with a plethora of code snippets and examples to help you grasp DSA concepts quickly. Each data structure and algorithm is accompanied by detailed explanations and code samples, allowing you to get started right away.
