# Pipieline outputs

This page contains information about the objects and files created by the `group_pipeline()` function as well as examples for how they can be used.
Note that all these examples are written in R but many of the same analyses and plots could also be done in Python.

## 1. Default outputs

### **`trials` (file: `output_dir/trials.csv`)**

The single trial data frame contains all the information from the log file (except for rows specified via `skip_log_rows` or `skip_log_conditions`), together with the corresponding single trial mean ERP amplitudes for each ERP component (specified via `components`).

```r
> trials <- res[[1]]
> head(trials)                                                                            
  participant_id item_id  semantics   RT      P1    N170    N400
1         Vp0001      44    related 1449  1.4548 -1.3999 -0.7654
2         Vp0001      47  unrelated 1725  6.0377  2.0890  0.9265
3         Vp0001      90  unrelated 2271 -2.8285  3.6264 -4.9010
4         Vp0001      25  unrelated 2194  3.5232  4.9644 -3.8442
5         Vp0001      20    related 1860  6.5149  3.8233  0.4319
6         Vp0001      14    related 1160  5.7174  3.3846 -2.3351
```

This data frame can be used, for instance, to fit a linear mixed-effects model predicting the N400 ERP amplitudes:

```r
> library(lme4)
> mod <- lmer(
+   N400 ~ semantics + (semantics | participant_id) + (semantics |Â item_id),
+   data = trials
+ )
```

### **`evokeds` (file: `output_dir/ave.csv`)**

This data frame contains the per-participant and averaged ERPs at each time point, at each channel, and for each experimental condition (or combination of conditions) as specified via the `average_by` option.

```r
> evokeds <- res[[2]]
> head(evokeds)     
  participant_id   label                  query   time    Fp1    Fpz    Fp2 ...
1         Vp0001 related semantics == "related" -0.500 0.5549 0.9599 1.3789 ...
2         Vp0001 related semantics == "related" -0.496 0.4824 0.7980 1.2616 ...
3         Vp0001 related semantics == "related" -0.492 0.5179 0.6926 1.1960 ...
4         Vp0001 related semantics == "related" -0.488 0.5798 0.6537 1.1883 ...
5         Vp0001 related semantics == "related" -0.484 0.5479 0.6327 1.1621 ...
6         Vp0001 related semantics == "related" -0.480 0.3763 0.5591 1.0230 ...
```

This data frame can be used, for instance, to plot the time course of the different semantic conditions as grand averages:

```r
> library(dplyr)
> library(ggplot2)
> evokeds %>%
+   filter(label %in% c("related", "unrelated")) %>%
+   ggplot(aes(x = time, y = N400, color = label)) +
+   stat_summary(geom = "line", fun = mean)    
```

To add [within-participant standard errors](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Plotting_means_and_error_bars_(ggplot2)/#error-bars-for-within-subjects-variables) as shaded regions around the waveforms:

```r
> evokeds %>%
+   Rmisc::summarySEwithin(
+     measurevar = "N400",
+     withinvars = c("label", "time"),
+     idvar = "participant_id"
+   ) %>%
+   mutate(time = as.numeric(as.character(time))) %>%
+   ggplot(aes(x = time, y = N400)) +
+   geom_ribbon(
+     aes(ymin = N400 - se, ymax = N400 + se, fill = label),
+     alpha = 0.2
+   ) +
+   geom_line(aes(color = label))
```

### **`config` (file: `output_dir/config.json`)**

This file contains a dictionary-like representation of the input options that were used by the pipeline.
It also lists rejected epochs per participant as well as automatically detected bad channels and ICA components (if applicable).

```r
> config <- res[[3]]
> rejected_epochs <- lengths(config[["auto_rejected_epochs"]])
> summary(rejected_epochs)  
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
   0.00    7.25   14.00   14.33   22.75   30.00 
```

## 2. Optional outputs

### **`clusters` (file: `output_dir/clusters.csv`)**

Only returned if one or more `perm_contrasts` has been specified.
This data frame contains the statistical results of the cluster-based permutations tests.
These are (a) the (uncorrected) cluster-forming *t* values (`t_obs`), (b) a label for each cluster of connected time points/channels (`cluster`), and (c) the corresponding cluster-level *p* value (`p_val`).
Cluster labels differentiate between positive-going clusters (`'pos_'`) and negative-going (`'neg_'`) clusters, and are sorted by their cluster-level *p* value.

```r
> clusters <- res[[4]]
> head(clusters)  
             contrast time channel   t_obs cluster p_val
1 related - unrelated    0     Fp1 -0.2529      NA     1
2 related - unrelated    0     Fpz  0.3768      NA     1
3 related - unrelated    0     Fp2 -0.5500      NA     1
4 related - unrelated    0     AF7 -0.6792      NA     1
5 related - unrelated    0     AF3  3.0780  pos_12  0.43
6 related - unrelated    0     AFz  3.3211  pos_12  0.43  
```

The data frame can be filtered for significant clusters (based on `p_val`) and, for instance, visualized using `geom_raster()` from `ggplot2`.

### **`tfr_evokeds` (file: `output_dir/tfr_ave.csv`)**

Only returned if `perform_tfr` is set to `True`.
It has the same information as `evokeds` but for the time-frequency representation of the EEG data.
That means (a) that it contains an additional column for the different frequencies (`freqs`) and (b) that the actual values at each channel are not ERP amplitudes but power (in units of percent signal change over baseline).

### **`tfr_clusters` (file: `output_dir/tfr_clusters.csv`)**

Only returned if `perform_tfr` is set to `True` and if one or more `perm_contrasts` has been specified.
It has the same information as `clusters` but for the cluster-based permutation tests of the time-frequency data.
It therefore contains an additional for the different frequencies (`freqs`).
