An implementation of methods described in 
["Git Re-basin"-paper by Ainsworth et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04836)

Can be applied to **arbitrary models**, without modification. 

(Well, *almost* arbitrary models, see [Limitations](#limitations)).

## Installation

Requirements should be automatically installed, but one of them is graphviz, 
which you might have to install per apt / brew / ... on your device.

The following install instructions are taken directly from 
[torchview's installation instructions](https://github.com/mert-kurttutan/torchview#installation).

Debian-based Linux distro (e.g. Ubuntu):

```Bash
apt-get install graphviz
```

Windows:

```Bash
choco install graphviz
```

macOS

```Bash
brew install graphviz
```

see more details [here](https://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html).


Then, install rebasin via pip:

```bash
pip install rebasin
```

## Usage

Currently, only weight-matching is implemented as a method for rebasing, 
and only a simplified form of linear interpolation is implemented.

The following is a minimal example. For now, the documentation lives in the docstrings,
though I intend to create a proper one. 
`PermutationCoordinateDescent` and `interpolation.LerpSimple`
are the main classes, beside `MergeMany` (see below).

```python
from rebasin import PermutationCoordinateDescent
from rebasin import interpolation

model_a, model_b, train_dl= ...
input_data = next(iter(train_dl))[0]

# Rebasin
pcd = PermutationCoordinateDescent(model_a, model_b, input_data)  # weight-matching
pcd.rebasin()  # Rebasin model_b towards model_a. Automatically updates model_b

# Interpolate
lerp = interpolation.LerpSimple(
    models=[model_a, model_b],
    devices=["cuda:0", "cuda:1"],  # Optional, defaults to cpu
    device_interp="cuda:2",  # Optional, defaults to cpu
    savedir="/path/to/save/interpolation"  # Optional, save all interpolated models
)
lerp.interpolate(steps=99)  # Interpolate 99 models between model_a and model_b
```

The `MergeMany`-algorithm is also implemented 
(though there will be interface-changes regarding the devices in the future):

```python
from rebasin import MergeMany
from torch import nn

class ExampleModel(nn.Module):
    ...

model_a, model_b, model_c = ExampleModel(), ExampleModel(), ExampleModel()
train_dl = ...

# Merge
merge = MergeMany(
    models=[model_a, model_b, model_c],
    working_model=ExampleModel(),
    input_data=next(iter(train_dl))[0],
)
merged_model = merge.run()
# The merged model is also accessible through merge.working_model,
#   but only after merge.run() has been called.
```

## Terminology

In this document, I will use the following terminology:

- **To rebasin**: To apply one of the methods described in the paper to a model,
    permuting the rows and columns of its weights (and biases)
- `model_a`: The model that stays unchanged
- `model_b`: The model that is changed by rebasin it towards `model_a`
    - `model_b (original)` for the unchanged, original `model_b`
    - `model_b (rebasin)` for the changed, rebasined `model_b`
- **Path**: A sequence of modules in a model

## Limitations

### Only some methods are implemented

For rebasin, only weight-matching is implemented via `rebasin.PermutationCoordinateDescent`.

For interpolation, only a simplified method of linear interpolation is implemented 
via `rebasin.interpolation.LerpSimple`.

### Limitations of the `PermutationCoordinateDescent`-class

The `PermutationCoordinateDescent`-class only permutes some Modules. 
Most modules should work, but others may behave unexpectedly. In this case, 
you need to add the module to [rebasin/modules.py](rebasin/modules.py);
make sure it is included in the `initialize_module`-function 
(preferably by putting it into the `SPECIAL_MODULES`-dict).

Additionally, the `PermutationCoordinateDescent`-class only works with
`nn.Module`s, not functions. There is a requirement to have the permuted model
produce the same output as the un-permuted `Module`, which is a pretty 
tight constraint. In some models, it isn't a problem at all, but especially in 
models with lots of short residual blocks, it may (but doesn't have to) be a problem.
Where it is a problem, few to no parameters get permuted, which defeats the purpose of rebasin.

For example, @tysam-code's [hlb-gpt](https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-gpt), a small but fast
language model implementation, isn't permuted at all. 
Vision transformers like `torchvision.models.vit_b_16` have only very few permutations
applied to them. In general, **transformer models don't work well**, because they 
reshape the input-tensor, and directly follow that up with residual blocks. 
This means that almost nothing of the model can be permuted 
(a single Linear layer between the reshaping and the first residual block would fix that,
but this isn't usually done...).

On the other hand, **CNNs usually work very well**.

If you are unsure, you can always print the model-graph! To do so, write:

```python
from rebasin import PermutationCoordinateDescent


pcd = PermutationCoordinateDescent(...)
print(pcd.pinit.model_graph)  # pinit stands for "PermutationInitialization"
```

## Results

For the full results, see [rebasin-results](https://github.com/snimu/rebasin-results)
(I don't want to upload a bunch of images to this repo, so the results are in their own repo).

The clearest results were produces on [hlb-CIFAR10](https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-CIFAR10).
For results on that model, see 
[here](https://github.com/snimu/rebasin-results/blob/main/hlb-CIFAR10/RESULTS.md).

Here is a little taste of the results for that model:

<p align="center">

        alt="hlb-CIFAR10: losses and accuracies of the model"
        width="600"
    />
</p>

While `PermutationCoordinateDescent` doesn't fully eliminate the loss-barrier, 
it does reduce it significantly, and, surprisingly, even moreso for the accuracy-barrier.

You can also find results for the `MergeMany`-algorithm there.
