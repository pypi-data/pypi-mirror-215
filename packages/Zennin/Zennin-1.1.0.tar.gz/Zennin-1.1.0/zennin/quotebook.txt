Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,

A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.”

At some disputed barricade,

And lead me into his dark land
And close my eyes and quench my breath

And I to my pledged word am true,
I shall not fail that rendezvous.”
