# Harmonic Mean of Relative Frequencies (HMRF)

HMRF is a method for automatic keyword extraction from a text corpus. This method favors words that maximize the difference between their frequency in one class (positive class) and their frequency in the rest of the classes.

## Parameters

- lang: str, default = 'english'. Language of the texts.

- positive_class: str or int, default = 1

- n: int, default = 50. Amount of keywords to extract.

- phrases: bool, default = False. If phrases will be extracted.

- n_phrases: int, default = 20. Amount of key phrases to extract.

- phrases_by: {'Freq', 'PMI', 'TTEST', 'CHI'}, default = 'PMI'. Strategy to extract key phrases.

## Usage (Python)

### Example 1

```
import hmrf

texts = ["I absolutely loved this movie! The storyline was captivating, the acting was superb, and the cinematography was stunning.",
         "This restaurant exceeded my expectations. The food was delicious, the service was impeccable, and the ambiance was delightful.",
	 "I'm so happy with my purchase! The product arrived on time, it works perfectly, and the customer support was excellent.",
	 "The hotel stay was amazing. The room was spacious and clean, the staff was friendly and accommodating, and the amenities were top-notch.",
	 "I highly recommend this book. The writing style is beautiful, the characters are well-developed, and the story kept me hooked till the end.",
	 "I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. It broke within a week, and the customer service was unhelpful.",
	 "The movie was a complete waste of time. The plot was confusing, the acting was terrible, and I regretted watching it.",
	 "The service at this restaurant was awful. The food took forever to arrive, the server was rude, and the prices were exorbitant.",
	 "I had a horrible experience with this airline. My flight was delayed, the seats were uncomfortable, and the staff was unprofessional.",
	 "I found this book to be poorly written. The characters were one-dimensional, the plot was predictable, and it lacked depth."]

labels = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

extractor = hmrf.Hmrf(n=10)
keywords = extractor.hmrf(texts, labels)
	
for kw in keywords:
    print(kw)

```

### Output
