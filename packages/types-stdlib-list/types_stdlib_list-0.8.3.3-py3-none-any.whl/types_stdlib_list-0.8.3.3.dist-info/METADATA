## Typing stubs for stdlib-list

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `stdlib-list` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`stdlib-list`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/stdlib-list. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `stdlib-list` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 0.9.0. Please uninstall the `types-stdlib-list`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `c402107f8afd57a1916ba116e6aafb5bf7a663f3` and was tested
with mypy 1.3.0, pyright 1.1.314, and
pytype 2023.6.2.
