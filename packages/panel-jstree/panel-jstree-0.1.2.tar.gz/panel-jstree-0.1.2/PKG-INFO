# ‚ú® panel-jstree

panel-jstree is a wrapper python wrapper around the javascript library [jstree](https://www.jstree.com) for use in [panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/). This allows for JSON-like representations of tree data. One very useful implementation provided is a server-side file browser.

You can install and use the package as simple as.

```bash
pip install panel-jstree
```

```python
import panel as pn
from panel_jstree import FileTree

pn.Column(FileTree())
```
