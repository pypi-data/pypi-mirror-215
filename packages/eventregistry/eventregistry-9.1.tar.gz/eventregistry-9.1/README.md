Event Registry is a Python package that can be used to easily access the news data available in [Event Registry](http://eventregistry.org/) through the API. The package can be used to query for articles or events by filtering using a large set of filters, like keywords, concepts, topics, sources, sentiment, date, etc. Details about the News API are available on the [landing page of the product](https://newsapi.ai/).

## Installation

Event Registry package can be installed using Python's pip installer. In the command line, simply type:

    pip install eventregistry

and the package should be installed. Alternatively, you can also clone the package from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EventRegistry/event-registry-python). After cloning it, open the command line and run:

    python setup.py install

### Validating installation

To ensure the package has been properly installed run python and type:

```python
import eventregistry
```

If you don't get any error messages, then your installation has been successful.

### Updating the package

As features are added to the package you will need at some point to update it. In case you have downloaded the package from GitHub simply do a `git pull`. If you have installed it using the `pip` command, then simply run

	pip install eventregistry --upgrade

### Authentication and API key

When making queries to Event Registry you will have to use an API key that you can obtain for free. The details on how to obtain and use the key are described in the [Authorization](../../wiki/EventRegistry-class#authorization) section.

## Four simple examples to get you interested

**Print a list of recently articles or blog posts from *US based sources* *with positive sentiment* mentioning phrases *"George Clooney"* or *"Sandra Bullock"***

```python
from eventregistry import *
er = EventRegistry(apiKey = YOUR_API_KEY)

# get the USA URI
usUri = er.getLocationUri("USA")    # = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States

q = QueryArticlesIter(
    keywords = QueryItems.OR(["George Clooney", "Sandra Bullock"]),
    minSentiment = 0.4,
    sourceLocationUri = usUri,
    dataType = ["news", "blog"])

# obtain at most 500 newest articles or blog posts, remove maxItems to get all
for art in q.execQuery(er, sortBy = "date", maxItems = 500):
    print(art)
```

**Print a list of most relevant *business* articles from the last month related to *Microsoft* or *Google*. The articles should be in any language (including Chinese, Arabic, ...)**

```python
from eventregistry import *
# allowUseOfArchive=False will allow us to search only over the last month of data
er = EventRegistry(apiKey = YOUR_API_KEY, allowUseOfArchive=False)

# get the URIs for the companies and the category
microsoftUri = er.getConceptUri("Microsoft")    # = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft
googleUri = er.getConceptUri("Google")          # = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google
businessUri = er.getCategoryUri("news business")    # = news/Business

q = QueryArticlesIter(
    conceptUri = QueryItems.OR([microsoftUri, googleUri]),
    categoryUri = businessUri)

# obtain at most 500 newest articles, remove maxItems to get all
for art in q.execQuery(er, sortBy = "date", maxItems = 500):
    print(art)
```


**Search for latest events related to Star Wars**

```python
from eventregistry import *
er = EventRegistry(apiKey = YOUR_API_KEY)

q = QueryEvents(keywords = "Star Wars")
q.setRequestedResult(RequestEventsInfo(sortBy = "date", count = 50))   # request event details for latest 50 events

# get the full list of 50 events at once
print(er.execQuery(q))
```

**Search for articles that (a) mention immigration, (b) are related to business, and (c) were published by news sources located in New York City**

```python
from eventregistry import *
er = EventRegistry(apiKey = YOUR_API_KEY)

q = QueryArticlesIter(
    # here we don't use keywords so we will also get articles that mention immigration using various synonyms
    conceptUri = er.getConceptUri("immigration"),
    categoryUri = er.getCategoryUri("business"),
    sourceLocationUri = er.getLocationUri("New York City"))

# obtain 500 articles that have were shared the most on social media
for art in q.execQuery(er, sortBy = "socialScore", maxItems = 500):
    print(art)
```

**What are the currently trending topics**

```python
from eventregistry import *
er = EventRegistry(apiKey = YOUR_API_KEY)

# top 10 trending concepts in the news
q = GetTrendingConcepts(source = "news", count = 10)
print(er.execQuery(q))
```
