# DataJoint Element - Experimental trials

+ `element-event` features a DataJoint pipeline design for event, trial, and block management. 

+ `element-event` is not a complete workflow by itself, but rather a modular design of tables and dependencies. 

+ `element-event` can be flexibly attached to any DataJoint workflow.

+ See the [Element Event documentation](https://elements.datajoint.org/description/event/) for the background information and development timeline.

+ For more information on the DataJoint Elements project, please visit https://elements.datajoint.org.  This work is supported by the National Institutes of Health.

## Element architecture

In diagram below, ***BehaviorRecording*** table starts immediately downstream from
***Session***. Recordings can be segmented into both trials, which are assumed to have 
duration, and events, which may be instantaneous. Researchers may find one or both  appropriate for their particular paradigm. A set of trials can be further organized into
blocks, representing a larger span of time. We provide an
[example workflow](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-trial/) with a
[pipeline script](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-trial/blob/main/workflow_trial/pipeline.py)
that models combining this Element with the corresponding 
[Element-Session](https://github.com/datajoint/element-session).

### Trial & Event Schemas

![trial and event schemas](./images/trial_event_diagram.svg)

## Installation

+ Install `element-event`
    ```
    pip install element-event
    ```

+ Upgrade `element-event` previously installed with `pip`
    ```
    pip install --upgrade element-event
    ```

<!---
+ Install `element-interface`

    + `element-interface` is a dependency of `element-event`, however it is not 
      contained within `requirements.txt`.

    ```
    pip install "element-interface @ git+https://github.com/datajoint/element-interface"
    ```

## Usage

### Element activation

To activate the `element-event`, one need to provide:

1. Schema names for the event or trial module
2. Upstream Session table: A set of keys identifying a recording session (see [
Element-Session](https://github.com/datajoint/element-session)).
3. Utility functions. See 
[example definitions here](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-trial/blob/main/workflow_trial/paths.py)

For more detail, check the docstring of the `element-event`:

```python
from element_event import event, trial

help(event.activate)
help(trial.activate)
```

### Element usage

+ See the 
[workflow-calcium-imaging](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-calcium-imaging), 
[workflow-array-ephys](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-array-ephys), and 
[workflow-miniscope](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-miniscope) 
repositories for example usages of `element-event`.
