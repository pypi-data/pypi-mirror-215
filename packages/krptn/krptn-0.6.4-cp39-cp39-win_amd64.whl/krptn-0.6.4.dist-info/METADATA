# Krptn

```shell
pip install krptn
```

## What problem do we solve?

**We all love Django and other web frameworks!** However, their primary focus is creating websites - not implementing secure storage for user data. One example is Django's built-in authentication system. While it hashes the password, it does not encrypt user data for you. Encryption is left to the developer...

**Wouldn't it be nice if encryption would also be handled?** Perhaps it could be handled in a zero knowledge model, such that, without the user entering credentials, not even the database administrator can read it?! This is exactly what we do!

**To prove that such is possible, we have a [Flask](https://github.com/krptn/flaskExample) and [Django](https://github.com/krptn/djangoExample) example on GitHub.**

## What do we do exactly?

We are building a user authentication and access management system (IAM) with [Zero Knowledge security](https://www.krptn.dev/news/zero-knowledge/). It is available as a python extension module. However we have certain [limitations](https://www.krptn.dev/news/limitations/).

How we achieve this?

- All data is encrypted (any data can be requested by the developer to be secured)
- Only the appropriate users' credentials can unlock the cryptosystem (this protects you from server-side attacks)

This gives you [Zero Knowledge security](https://www.krptn.dev/news/zero-knowledge/) without ever needing to even notice it! It protects you from server side attacks.

## Try it out

Quickly install the package with pip for Python>3.9:

```shell
pip install krptn
```

Have a look at our [User Authentication documentation](https://docs.krptn.dev/README-USER-AUTH.html), and create some users.

Ready to integrate it into your WebApp? Have a look at some of our integration's available with [Django and Flask](https://docs.krptn.dev/README.html#integration-with-web-frameworks)!
