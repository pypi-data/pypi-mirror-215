## What's new

A major revision, v4.0.0 introduces a lot of new stuff including:
- Complete recoding of the core with better coding and commenting which hopefully makes it easier to implement custom features
- Modification of interfacing with parameters and results through method attributes instead of bulky dictionaries
- Stability of the half step Fourier method, allowing to use a soliton solution as an original state for the LLE
- Allowing arbitrary number of driving pump, according to Taheri et al The European Physical Journal D 2017. and our paper on Nature Communication (Moille et al. Nature Communication 2021)
- Julia compatibility with version 1.8 (current as of 05/01/2023) and above

## How to Cite Us?

Please, if you use this package and it helps you with your research and publication, cite us in your paper. Not only it allows us to have a better idea of new things people are interested in and how to keep improving the solver, but it also help us building a community where every body could help maintaining the solver to suit better the needs of everybody.
You can cite our paper published in the Journal of Research of National Institute of Standards and Technology available [here](https://doi.org/10.6028/jres.124.012), with the following bibtex entry:

## How to install

As pyLLE relies on a Julia back-end, please prior to installing this package be sure that Julia is installed on your machine or visit the julia [package download page](https://julialang.org/downloads/) to install it. The code should now work with any recent version of Julia.

Once Julia installed, the different packages needed to run pyLLE, either python or julia related, will be automatically downloaded and installed. Just a heads up, the installation of the package can vary in time, especially because of Julia that might rebuild the cache.

pyLLE will look by default to find the Julia binary in the `/opt/bin/julia`, which you can make it happen either in MacOS

```bash
ln -s /Applications/Julia-<version>.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia /opt/bin/julia
```
 
 or Linux

```bash
ln -s <julia_path>/bin/julia /opt/bin/julia
```

Note that if this step is skipped it is alright as an update of the pyLLE package provide a way to specify the julia binary you would like to use specifyin ``solver.SolveTemporal(bin = <where julia bin is>)``




Now, one can simply  automatic install, just pip it :

```bash
pip install pyLLE
```
For a manual install, download the .zip of the repository or clone it and install with the setup.py script. 


## Checking that everything works correctly

Launch a julia console and within type the commands:

```julia
using HDF5
using FFTW
using LinearAlgebra
```

if any of the previous command throw an issue, mostly it is because it is not installed. One way to fix it is to remove the installed packaged to remove the cache

- for linux and mac os user: remove everything in ~/.julia/
- for windows users: remove everything in C:\Users\<your user name>\.julia\

Then enter the pacakge manager for julia by typing in the julia console:

```julia
julia>]
```

then
```julia
(v1.1) pkg>add HDF5
(v1.1) pkg>add FFTW
```
