<h1>Docstruct</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Docstruct is a package that parses the results of optical character recognition (OCR) algorithms, such as Tesseract (using the hOCR output) or Textract (AWS), into a tree structure. This tree structure allows for the visual representation of the document, with each node representing a document, page, paragraph, line, word, or character, along with its bounding box. The package also includes support for paragraph detection and text splitting that preserves logical units.</p>
