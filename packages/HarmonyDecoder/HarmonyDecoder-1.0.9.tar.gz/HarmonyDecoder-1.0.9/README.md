HARMONY DECODER

Project made for fun, to help people with harmony tasks.

The project itself is very simple - it takes input as functions in specific format, each function has to be separated by space, and solves the harmony task.
All basic harmony rules are being checked to create all solutions. Solutions are sorted by their quality.

FORMAT:
Symbol^Position/Root+Added+-Deleted-*Alterations*=Suspensions=

Eg.:
T^/++--**== (C E G in C major)
mT^1/1++--**== (C Eb G in C major, in position of root)
S^3/5++--**== (F A C in C major, in position of third and fifth in root)
D^/+9+-5-**== (G B F A in C major, with deleted fifth)
Sii^/++--*3#,5b*== (D F# Ab in C major, in with sharp third and lowered fifth)
