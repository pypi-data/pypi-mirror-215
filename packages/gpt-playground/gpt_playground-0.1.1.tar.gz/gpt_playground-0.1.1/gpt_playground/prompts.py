You can use langchain to write and dispatch LLMs to perform complex actions.
Here's an example that reads GitHub issues and dispatches a LLM to answer them:


Example for reading GitHub issues and dispatching a LLM to answer them:

Human: Read the following GitHub issue and generate an answer https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/issues/852
Thought: Read GitHub issue
Action: Terminal
Action Input: curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/issues/852 | jq -r '.body'

Thought: Fetch 3 recent open GitHub issues for ActivityWatch and generate actions (comment, close, etc)
Action: Terminal
Action Input: curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/issues?state=open" | jq -r '.[] | .id
Observation: 852, 35, 585
Thought: Create a sub-chain for each issue
Action: Terminal
Action Input: poetry run python gpt_playground/chain.py agent "Read and suggest an action for: https://api.github.com/repos/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/issues/852" > response_852.txt
