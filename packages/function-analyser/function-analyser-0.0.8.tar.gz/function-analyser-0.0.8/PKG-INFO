# function-analyser

TL;DR;
```commandline
pip install function-analyser

```
There is much debate about the ideal length of a function or method.

E.g.
```
The first rule of functions is that they should be small.
The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that.
Functions should not be 100 lines long.
Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long.
```

Common sense, therefore, offers one solution.

However, I have taken a different approach in running
analysis on many codebases and using this to calibrate
a functional analysis tool to run on your *own* codebase.

The results are encapsulated in this useful function analysis
tool.
