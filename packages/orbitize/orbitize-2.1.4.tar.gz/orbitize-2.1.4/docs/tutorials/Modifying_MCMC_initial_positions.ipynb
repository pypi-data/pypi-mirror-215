    "# Modifying MCMC Initial Positions\n",
    "\n",
    "by Henry Ngo (2019) & Sarah Blunt (2021) & Mireya Arora (2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you set up the MCMC Sampler, the initial position of your walkers are randomly determined. Specifically, they are uniformly distributed in your Prior phase space. This tutorial will show you how to change this default behaviour so that the walkers can begin at locations you specify. For instance, if you have an initial guess for the best fitting orbit and want to use MCMC to explore posterior space around this peak, you may want to start your walkers at positions centered around this peak and distributed according to an N-dimensional Gaussian distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This tutorial is meant to be read after reading the [MCMC Introduction tutorial](https://orbitize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/MCMC_tutorial.html). If you are wondering what walkers are, you should start there!\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Driver` class is the main way you might interact with `orbitize!` as it automatically reads your input, creates all the `orbitize!` objects needed to do your calculation, and defaults to some commonly used parameters or settings. However, sometimes you want to work directly with the underlying API to do more advanced tasks such as changing the MCMC walkers' initial positions, or [modifying the priors](https://orbitize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Modifying_Priors.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks you through how to do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals of this tutorial**:\n",
    "- Learn to modify the MCMC `Sampler` object\n",
