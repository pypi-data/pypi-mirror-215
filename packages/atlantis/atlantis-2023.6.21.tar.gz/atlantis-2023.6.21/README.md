  - progress bars
  
## *collections*
This module of the package [***atlantis***](README.md) helps with working with collections.

### *`flatten`*
```python
from atlantis.collections import flatten
flatten([1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6], 7], 8])
```
returns: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`

### *`List`*
This class inherits from Python's list class but implements a few 
additional functionalities.

```python
from atlantis.collections import List
l = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 2, [1, 2], [1, 2])
```

Flattening: 
```python
l.flatten()
>>> List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]
```

Finding duplicates:
```python
l.get_duplicates()
>>> List: [2, List: [1, 2]]
```
**Note:** the ***list*** elements of a ***List*** automatically get converted to ***Lists***, recursively.

## *ds* (Data Science)
This module provides data science tools for:
- data wrangling, 
- validation, 
- tuning,
- sampling, 
- evaluation,
- clustering, and 
- parallel processing of machine learning models.

### *KMeans* Clustering
I have used the `KMeans` class from both *sklearn* and that of *pyspark* and was frustrated 
by two problems: (a) even though the two classes do exactly the same thing their interfaces
are vastly different and (b) some of the simplest operations are very hard to do with 
both classes. I solved this problem by creating my own `KMeans` class that is a wrapper 
aroung both of those classes and uses the appropriate one automatically without 
complicating it for the data scientist programmer. 

#### Usage

```python
from atlantis.ds.clustering import KMeans

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, n_jobs=10)
kmeans.fit(X=X)

predictions = kmeans.predict(X=X)
transformed_x = kmeans.transform(X=X)
```

### Clustering Optimization

#### Usage
```python
from atlantis.ds.clustering import ClusteringOptimizer

clustering_optimizer = ClusteringOptimizer(min_k=2, max_k=16, n_jobs=10)
clustering_optimizer.fit(X=X)
print(f'best number of clusters: {clustering_optimizer.optimal_number_of_clusters}')
```
