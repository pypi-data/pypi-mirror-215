This packages provides "live actor" and "application monitored communication" infrastructure for the
[GridWorks SpaceHeat SCADA](https://github.com/thegridelectric/gw-scada-spaceheat-python) project. This separation
allows the scada code to be more focussed on on application specific details and provides the potential to re-use the
"live actor" and "application monitored" infrastructure.

## Features

- [](Proactor), a single threaded event loop running on asyncio, for exchanging messages between the main application
  object, "live actor" subobjects and MQTT clients.
- A [communication state] ("active" or not) for each external communications link is available to the proactor and
  sub-objects. "Active" communications is defined as ALL of the following:
  - The underlying communications mechanism (MQTT) is connected.
  - All input channels of underlying mechanism (MQTT topics) are established.
  - A application messages requiring acknowledgement have been ACKed in timely fashion (by default 5 seconds).
  - A message has been received "recently" (by default within 1 minute).
- Reliable delievery of "Events" generated locally. Generated Events are stored locally until they are acknowledged
  and unacknowledged Events are retransmitted when the "Active" communication state is restored.
- [](gwproactor_test), a test package for development and test environments of projects that implement a class derived
  from [](Proactor), allowing the derived class to be tested with the base-class tests.

## Requirements

Testing requires an MQTT broker. This can be installed on a mac with:

```shell
brew install mosquitto
brew services restart mosquitto
```

Alternatively, the MQTT broker used by tests be controlled by .env file as described in [](DefaultTestEnv).
