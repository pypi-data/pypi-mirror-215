The naming convention is very important, be consistent, but make sure each conformer has a different name (I do this by adding numbers at the end of their names, signifying their ranks from the conformational searches).\n3) Change your input directory in admin.py to where you store the coordinate files and run it. This will group all of the conformers into individual directories.\n4) Change your input directory in prepGaussian.py to the same location and run it. This will generate the Gaussian input files and job submission files in the corresponding directory. Make sure you check at least a few of the files generated to see that you got the charges, spacing at the end of file, solvents, resources requested, etc right. I named all of the Gaussian job submission jobs with *.sh, feel free to change it according to your preference (Line 52 in prepGaussian.py).\n5) Copy the directories across to the HPCs (Raijin/Gadi/Tinaroo/Awoonga, NOTE: The details for job submissions on Raijin and RCC HPCs are different, specify the cluster before running prepGaussian.py in Step 4).\n6) Change directory to the directory that contains all the conformers subdirectories and run \'gsub.sh\' (Make sure it\'s an executable, if you can\'t run it, use chmod to change it). This will submit all of the Gaussian submission jobs to the HPC. Note that prior to this you need to adjust Line 6 in the gsub.sh file to the naming convention you give to your Gaussian submit files if you have changed them in the prepGaussian.py.\n7) After the jobs are done, copy them over to your local machine.\n8) Change your input directory in tabulate.py to the directory that contains all the conformers and run it. Note that you need to have the Python package pandas installed for it to work.\n\n#### visAnalysis\nenergyLeveller.py - Draws energy profile diagrams.\nplotConfig.py - Stores configuration for figure-plotting functions.\nplotFigs.py - Plots figures for QM data analysis.\n\n\n### Molecular Dynamics Simulations (mdsim)\n- config.py contains some variables that are used repetitively for almost all files.\n- baseID.py plots the distances between potential base species and the targeted protons.\n- bbRMSD.py plots the RMSD of BTK backbones over time, for the purpose of checking the stability of the simulations.\n- hbondAnalysis.py plots the distribution of the number of hydrogen bonds between BTK backbones over time.\n- ligDihedral.py plots the distribution of the critical C=C-C=O dihedral angle near BTK active site over time.\n- SCbondDist.py plots the distances between the reacting S and C atoms over time.\n- sumCharge.py sums up the charges to aid in the parameterisation of non-standard amino acids.\n- prepMTB.py was written during an attempt to map the unbound ligand to covalently bound ligand. Was not utilised in the end.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing? Check out the contributing guidelines. Please note that this project is released with a Code of Conduct.
