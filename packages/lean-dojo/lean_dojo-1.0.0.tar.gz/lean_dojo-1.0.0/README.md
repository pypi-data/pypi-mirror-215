LeanDojo: Machine Learning for Theorem Proving in Lean
======================================================

![Model](images/LeanDojo.jpg)

[LeanDojo](https://leandojo.org/) is a Python library for learningâ€“based theorem provers in Lean, supporting both [Lean 3](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean) and [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/). It provides two main features:

* Extracting data (proof states, tactics, premises, etc.) from Lean repos.
* Interacting with Lean programmatically.
