# History
comicapi originates [here](https://github.com/davide-romanini/comicapi), was integrated into [ComicStreamer](https://github.com/davide-romanini/ComicStreamer), was modified in [this fork](https://github.com/kounch/ComicStreamer), and has now been extracted and packaged by yours truly (Iris W).

# Installation
you can use pip to install this. cbr support is off by defaultâ€”you'll need to do `pip install rarfile` as well as having "unrar" available.
