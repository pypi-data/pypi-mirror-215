# Ghga Transpiler

GHGA-Transpiler - a short description

## Description

<!-- Please provide a short overview of the features of this service.-->

This repo is a template for creating a new microservice.

The directories, files, and their structure herein are recommendations
from the GHGA Dev Team.

### Naming Conventions
The github repository contains only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens "-",
e.g.: `my-microservice`

The python package (and thus the source repository) contains underscores "_"
instead of hyphens, e.g.: `my_microservice`
However, an abbreviated version is prefered as package name.

### Adapt to your service
This is just a template and needs some adaption to your specific use case.

Please search for **"please adapt"** comments. They will indicate all locations
that need modification. Once the adaptions are in place, please remove these #
comments.

Finally, follow the instructions to generate the README.md described in
[`./readme_generation.md`](./readme_generation.md). Please also adapt this markdown file
by providing an overview of the feature of the package.


## Installation
We recommend using the provided Docker container.

A pre-build version is available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ghga/ghga-transpiler):
```bash
docker pull ghga/ghga-transpiler:1.0.0
```

Or you can build the container yourself from the [`./Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile):
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
docker build -t ghga/ghga-transpiler:1.0.0 .
```

For production-ready deployment, we recommend using Kubernetes, however,
for simple use cases, you could execute the service using docker
on a single server:
```bash
# The entrypoint is preconfigured:
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghga/ghga-transpiler:1.0.0 --help
```

If you prefer not to use containers, you may install the service from source:
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
pip install .

# To run the service:
ghga_transpiler --help
```

## Configuration
### Parameters

The service requires the following configuration parameters:


### Usage:

A template YAML for configurating the service can be found at
[`./example-config.yaml`](./example-config.yaml).
Please adapt it, rename it to `.ghga_transpiler.yaml`, and place it into one of the following locations:
- in the current working directory were you are execute the service (on unix: `./.ghga_transpiler.yaml`)
- in your home directory (on unix: `~/.ghga_transpiler.yaml`)

The config yaml will be automatically parsed by the service.

**Important: If you are using containers, the locations refer to paths within the container.**

All parameters mentioned in the [`./example-config.yaml`](./example-config.yaml)
could also be set using environment variables or file secrets.

For naming the environment variables, just prefix the parameter name with `ghga_transpiler_`,
e.g. for the `host` set an environment variable named `ghga_transpiler_host`
(you may use both upper or lower cases, however, it is standard to define all env
variables in upper cases).

To using file secrets please refer to the
[corresponding section](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/#secret-support)
of the pydantic documentation.



## Architecture and Design:
<!-- Please provide an overview of the architecture and design of the code base.
Mention anything that deviates from the standard triple hexagonal architecture and
the corresponding structure. -->

This is a Python-based service following the Triple Hexagonal Architecture pattern.
It uses protocol/provider pairs and dependency injection mechanisms provided by the
[hexkit](https://github.com/ghga-de/hexkit) library.


## Development
For setting up the development environment, we rely on the
[devcontainer feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) of vscode
in combination with Docker Compose.

To use it, you have to have Docker Compose as well as vscode with its "Remote - Containers"
extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) installed.
Then open this repository in vscode and run the command
`Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the vscode "Command Palette".

This will give you a full-fledged, pre-configured development environment including:
- infrastructural dependencies of the service (databases, etc.)
- all relevant vscode extensions pre-installed
- pre-configured linting and auto-formating
- a pre-configured debugger
- automatic license-header insertion

Moreover, inside the devcontainer, a convenience commands `dev_install` is available.
It installs the service with all development dependencies, installs pre-commit.

The installation is performed automatically when you build the devcontainer. However,
if you update dependencies in the [`./setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg) or the
[`./requirements-dev.txt`](./requirements-dev.txt), please run it again.
