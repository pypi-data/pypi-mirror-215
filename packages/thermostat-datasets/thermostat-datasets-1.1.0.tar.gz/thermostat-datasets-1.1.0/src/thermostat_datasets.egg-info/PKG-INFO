Thermostat is a large collection of NLP model explanations and accompanying analysis tools. Combines explainability methods from the captum library with Hugging Face's datasets and transformers. Mitigates repetitive execution of common experiments in Explainable NLP and thus reduces the environmental impact and financial roadblocks. Increases comparability and replicability of research. Reduces the implementational burden.
