# countach

![Tests](https://github.com/HWRacing/countach/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

A library for extracting data from A2L files generated by Ecocoder for the EV2274A. Information on usage is located [here](docs/usage.md), and other documentation is linked below:

- [Characteristics](docs/characteristic.md)
- [Measurements](docs/measurement.md)
- [Types](docs/types.md)
- [Fixed-Point Types](docs/fixed.md)

## Disclaimer

This package will probably not work with anything other than the EV2274A and the Ecocoder library. This is by design - it's far easier for us to build something that just suits our needs instead of trawling through A2L standards and implementing a proper parser.
