Building on top of the groundwork laid out by Solidly, our team has addressed that first iteration's core issues to realize its full potential. The team behind Velodrome Finance previously launched veDAO, an initiative incubated by Information Token. veDAO's founding mandate was to engage with the Solidly ecosystem, a protocol launched on the Fantom network by Andre Cronje, while driving long-term value to the veDAO community. The veDAO team has since developed deep subject matter expertise on both Solidly, the veNFT primitive, and the ve(3,3) mechanism, becoming the go-to resource for protocols and chains seeking support around these topics.",
