For more clarity, this section will be split in 2 parts: one about the
documentation of the different models directly related to the QoS definition,
what concerns directly the final user. The other part, more general, will group
all the documentations of the rest of the framework (the backend, the
application, etc.), and will be useful if you want to understand how all the
thing works and improve it.
