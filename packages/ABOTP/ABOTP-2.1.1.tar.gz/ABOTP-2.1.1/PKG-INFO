- Provides a server-side implementation (Server) for accepting client connections and handling data transmission.
- Offers a client-side implementation (Client) for connecting to a server and exchanging data.
- Supports sending and receiving lists of byte objects (bytes) as data payloads.
- Provides error handling for socket-related exceptions and connection status errors.
- Works with Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.
