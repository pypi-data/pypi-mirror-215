The Car Rental System is a command-line application that allows users to manage vehicles and customers for a car rental service. It provides functionality for adding, deleting, and searching for cars, as well as managing customer information and renting out cars. The system uses JSON files to store and retrieve data, and it supports both normal cars and electric cars.

Files:

main.py: This file is the entry point of the application. It imports the necessary functions from the menu.py file and contains the main loop that prompts the user for actions.

menu.py: This file contains the menu functions and ASCII art for the different menus. It also imports the database.py file and the necessary classes and functions from it. The menu functions handle user input and perform the corresponding actions based on the choices made.

database.py: This file contains the Database class, which is responsible for handling JSON file operations. It includes functions to load and save car and customer data from and to JSON files. The class also provides utility functions to manipulate car and customer data.

car.py: This file defines the Car and ElectricCar classes, which represent the car objects in the system. The Car class represents a normal car, while the ElectricCar class represents an electric car. Both classes have methods to get and set car attributes and convert car objects to dictionaries.

customer.py: This file defines the Customer class, which represents a customer object in the system. The class has methods to get and set customer attributes and manage the rented car for each customer.
