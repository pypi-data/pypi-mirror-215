#SHIVA AI

Shiva AI is an OpenAI-powered Python module created to help developers easily integrate artificial intelligence into their Python projects. AI2PY provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating AI-generated text, images, and image variations. An OpenAI API Key is required.

The module contains functions to create text, create text commands, create images, and create image variations. The init function initializes the class with an api_key. The create_text function takes in data and a word count and uses the OpenAI API to generate text based on the data. The create_text_command function takes in a command, data, and a word count and uses the OpenAI API to generate text based on the command and data. The create_image function takes in prompt text and an image size and uses the OpenAI API to generate an image based on the prompt text. The create_image_variation function takes in data and an image size and uses the OpenAI API to generate an image variation based on the data. The options class contains two functions: display_imagesizes and image_resize. The display_imagesizes function prints out the required image sizes for the OpenAI API. The image_resize function takes in an image and a size and resizes the image to the specified size.

In addition, Shiva AI also provides a set of pre-trained models that can be used for various tasks such as natural language processing, computer vision, and more. These models can be used to quickly build AI applications without having to train your own models from scratch.
