 *
 * `prob_dot_prod` treats each of the rows as represeting two real-valued
 * functions (1D gaussian distributions, with those parameters), which it
 * measures the angle betwee in L2. Read the `peak.h` documentation to get a
 * better understanding of how the metric in L2 space works. We end up with a
 * very similar formula as the 2D case:

     $$angle(u_i, v_i, s_{u_i}, s_{v_i}) = \sqrt{\frac{2s_{v_i}s_{u_i}}{s_{v_i}^2 + s_{u_i}^2}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{(u_i-v_i)^2}{s_{v_i}^2 + s_{u_i}^2}\right)}$$
 
 * The return value of the routine is this expression:

     $$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}u_iv_i angle(u_i, v_i, s_{u_i}, s_{v_i})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}u_iv_i}$$

 * , which is the weighted average of the products of the means by the
 * similarity of the functions.
 *
 * The default for desingularization should be 1e-4
