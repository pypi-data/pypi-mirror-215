# Why Morph-KGC

Before starting with the development of **Morph-KGC**, we analyzed the performance and features of several knowledge graph construction engines, as described in this **[paper](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2873/paper11.pdf)**. Most of these engines presented issues when processing large volumes of data, as well as limited functionality or poor compliance with **[R2RML](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/)** and **[RML](https://w3id.org/rml/core/spec)**. Morph-KGC has been designed with **performance** in mind, while remaining robust and feature-rich. In addition, it is currently the only engine that supports **[RML-star](https://w3id.org/rml/star/spec)**, enabling the generation of the emerging **[RDF-star](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/cg-spec/2021-12-17.html)** data model.

## Reasons to Use Morph-KGC

### Performance

Morph-KGC relies on the usage of **[mapping partitioning](https://content.iospress.com/download/semantic-web/sw223135?id=semantic-web%2Fsw223135)** to achieve efficient knowledge graph materialization. Morph-KGC can run mapping rules in **parallel** using the full power of the CPU. For scenarios that require to maintain the memory usage low, it is possible to use **sequential** processing, preventing the entire knowledge graph to be loaded in memory.

Additional optimizations are also implemented to increase efficiency: **[redundant self-join elimination](https://content.iospress.com/download/semantic-web/sw223135?id=semantic-web%2Fsw223135)**, **[vectorized operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming)**, **[hash joins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_join)** and more.

### W3C Compliance

Morph-KGC adopts the **[W3C](https://www.w3.org/)** Recommendation **[R2RML](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/)** mapping language to map relational databases to **[RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/)**. In addition, it supports **[RML](https://w3id.org/rml/core/spec)**, **[RML-star](https://w3id.org/rml/star/spec)**, **[RML-FNML](https://w3id.org/rml/fnml/spec)** and [YARRRML](https://rml.io/yarrrml/spec/), which are being further developed by the **[Knowledge Graph Construction W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/kg-construct/)**.

### Reliability

Morph-KGC is being used for all our knowledge graph construction projects at the **[Ontology Engineering Group](https://oeg.fi.upm.es/)**, and other organizations have adopted it as well for their **[RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/)** and **[RDF-star](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/cg-spec/2021-12-17.html)** materialization pipelines. This is why we put strong emphasis in keeping it **stable**, with **solid** releases. The engine is under **[continuous integration](https://github.com/morph-kgc/morph-kgc/actions)** using **[R2RML test cases](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/rdb2rdf/test-cases/)**, **[RML test cases](https://github.com/kg-construct/rml-core/tree/main/test-cases)** and **[RML-star test cases](https://github.com/kg-construct/rml-star/tree/main/test-cases)**, in addition to more complex ones.

We also frequently test Morph-KGC in scenarios involving large volumes of data with the **[LUBM4OBDA](https://github.com/oeg-upm/lubm4obda)**, **[NPD](https://github.com/ontop/npd-benchmark)** and **[GTFS-Madrid](https://github.com/oeg-upm/gtfs-bench)** benchmarks.

### RDF-star

**[RDF-star](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/cg-spec/2021-12-17.html)** extends the **[RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/)** data model with a compact alternative to the **[standard RDF reification](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/#reification)** that has been implemented by several **[triplestore vendors](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/implementations.html)**. Morph-KGC is currently the only knowledge graph construction engine implementing **[RML-star](https://w3id.org/rml/star/spec)**, allowing to generate **[RDF-star](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/cg-spec/2021-12-17.html)** knowledge graphs in a systematic and declarative manner.

### Free & Open Source

Morph-KGC is available under the permissive **[Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/morph-kgc/morph-kgc/blob/main/LICENSE)**, which allows commercial use, modification, distribution, patent use and private use.
