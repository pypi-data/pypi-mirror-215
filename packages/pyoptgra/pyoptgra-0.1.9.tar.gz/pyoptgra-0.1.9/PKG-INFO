This repository provides *pyoptgra*, a python package wrapping (and including) OPTGRA.
OPTGRA is an optimization algorithm developed and implemented by Johannes Schoenmaekers, it is specifically designed for near-linear constrained problems, which commonly occur in trajectory optimization.

The full documentation can be found here_.

.. _here: https://esa.github.io/pyoptgra/

Installation
============

With Pip
--------

Pyoptgra is available on PyPi and can be installed with pip:

* ``pip install pyoptgra``

Compile from Source
-------------------

First install a C++ compiler, a fortran compiler, cmake, python and python build, then clone the repository and build with ``python -m build``

Usage
=====

Pyoptgra is designed as a pygmo_ user-defined algorithm: First create an instance of the *optgra* class with all relevant parameters, then pass a pygmo.population containing your problem to the instance's *evolve* method:

.. _pygmo: https://esa.github.io/pygmo2/

>>> import pygmo
>>> import pyoptgra
>>> prob = pygmo.problem(pygmo.schwefel(30)) # using the schwefel test problem from pygmo, with 30 dimensions
>>> pop = pygmo.population(prob, 1)
>>> algo = pygmo.algorithm(pyoptgra.optgra())
>>> pop = algo.evolve(pop) # the actual call to OPTGRA
