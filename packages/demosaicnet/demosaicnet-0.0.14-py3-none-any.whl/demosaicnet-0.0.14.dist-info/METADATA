A minimal pytorch implementation of "Deep Joint Demosaicking and Denoising" [Gharbi2016]

# Installation

From this repo:

```shell
python setup.py install
```

Using pip:

```shell
pip install demosaicnet
```

Then run the demo script with:

```shell
python scripts/demosaicnet_demo.py output
```

To train a dummy model on the demo dataset provided, run:

```shell
python scripts/train.py --data demosaicnet/data/dummy_dataset --checkpoint_dir ckpt
```

To build and update the whee:

```shell
pip install wheel twine
make distribution
make upload_distribution
```

# FAQ

- **How is noise handled? Where is the pretrained model?** The noise-aware model is not implementation, see the earlier Caffe implementation for that <https://github.com/mgharbi/demosaicnet_caffe>
- **How do I train this?** The script `scripts/train.py` is a good start to setup your training job, but I haven't tested it yet, I recommend rolling your own.
