class Deferred(object):
    """
    Defer an action such as function calls, item access, and attribute access to a later stage.
    This is used in dynaplot:
    
        fig = figure()                # the DynanicFig returned by figure() is derived from Deferred
        ax  = fig.add_subplot()       # Deferred call for add_subplot()
        lns = ax.plot( x, y )[0]      # This is a deferred call: plot() and then [] are iteratively deferred.
        fig.render()                  # renders the figure and executes first plot() then [0]
        lns.set_ydata( y2 )           # we can now access the resulting Line2D object via the Deferred wrapper
        fig.render()                  # update graph
        
    Typically, a code user would create a class which can defer actions by deriving from this class.
    For example assume there is a class A which we want to defer.
    
    class DeferredA( Deferred ):    
        def __init__( self ):
            Deferred.__init__( info = "A" )
            self.a = None
        def create( self, *kargs_A, **kwargs_A ):
            a = A( *kargs_A, **kwargs_A )
            self._dereference( a )
    
    deferred_A = DeferredA()
    fx = deferred_A.call_a_function( x )    # will defer call to 'call_a_function'
    ix = deferred_A[0]                      # will defer index access
    cl = deferred_A("hello")                # will defer __call__
    
    deferred_A.create( 1, x=2 )             # actually create A
                                            # This will trigger execution of all deferred actions
                                            # in order.
    
    See cdxbasics.dynaplot.DynamicFig as an example.
