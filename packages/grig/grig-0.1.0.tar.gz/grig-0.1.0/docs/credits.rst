The Grig package was originally developed as part of the data reduction
pipelines for the SOFIA project, as sofia_redux.toolkit.resampling.  The
Python package was principally developed by Dan Perera, with reference to
an IDL implementation by Melanie Clarke, and an initial idea and prototype
developed by Dr. William Vacca.
