Kernel Resampling
=================

The kernel resampler can take a set of irregular or regular data points, and
interpolate them onto given coordinates through convolution with an irregular
or regular kernel in N-dimensions.  The base algorithm is very similar to the
:class:`ResamplePolynomial` class in that fits are processed in blocks
according to overlaps between the sample space and fitting space.  However,
rather than defining a polynomial for interpolation, a spline is used to
represent the given kernel and used to produce a convolution of that kernel
and all samples within the range, centered at each fit coordinate.

Splines are represented and evaluated using the :class:`Spline` class.  Please
see :ref:`grig_toolkit_splines` for further details.  Here, irregular
refers to a set of arbitrary coordinates, while regular implies that the
coordinates and values of the samples or kernel exist on a regularly spaced
grid.

Use Cases
=========
The main use case for the :class:`KernelResampler` is to perform convolutions
when either the sample space or kernel consists of irregular coordinates, or
a smooth continuous function should be used to represent a noisy kernel.  For
a more standard convolution involving both regular sample space and a regular
kernel, it is much faster to use standard ND convolution algorithms such as
:func:`scipy.ndimage.convolve`.

Caveats
=======
1. By default, an attempt will be made to fit any kernel exactly (smoothing=0).
While this is suitable for most regular kernels, it may necessary to increase
smoothing for irregular kernels to achieve a valid spline fit.  Invalid spline
fits result in a runtime error which may also provide information on how to
produce a valid fit.

2. Convolution is generally of the form:

    .. math::
        :nowrap:

        \begin{eqnarray}
            f(x) = \frac{\sum_{\Omega}{d k}}
                        {\sum_{\Omega}{k}}
        \end{eqnarray}

where :math:`\Omega` is the window centered around :math:`x`, :math:`k` is the
kernel, and :math:`d` are the data samples in the window.  This is not always
suitable in cases where the kernel contains negative values and may result in
misleading or unexpected output results.  In this case, the solution may be
changed to:

    .. math::
        :nowrap:

        \begin{eqnarray}
            f(x) = \frac{\sum_{\Omega}{d k}}
                        {\sum_{\Omega}{|k|}}
        \end{eqnarray}

by setting `absolute_weights=True` during call().  By default, absolute_weights
will be set to `True` if the kernel contains negative values and `False`
otherwise.  Note that `absolute_weights` will also be applied to any output
weights if requested by the user.

3. The resampler naturally normalizes the kernel during convolution.  If this
is not desirable, the normalization can be removed by setting `normalize=False`
during call().


Examples
========

In the following example, we shall convolve an image with an irregular kernel
which is effective at detecting edges.  Firstly we plot a reconstructed
regular kernel from the irregular input and then apply it to a regular image.
Note that the kernel contains negative values so standard convolution may result
in misleading values if normalization factor is not taken as the sum of absolute
kernel values.  This is done automatically if negative values are detected in
the kernel and the absolute_weight parameter is not explicitly set by the user.
Also note that the smoothing factor has been set to a small non-zero value in
order to effectively fit a spline, as an exact fit may not always be possible
with irregular coordinates.
