Basic Usage Example
===================

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from grig.resample import Resample, resample

    x = np.arange(10)
    y = x + 100

    # initialize the Resample object
    resampler = Resample(x, y)
    y2 = resampler(4.5)  # get the resampled result at x = 4.5

    # or perform the resampling in a single step with resample
    y2 = resample(x, y, 4.5)


Fitting noisy data
==================

In the following example we generate two second order polynomial fits
to a noisy sine wave.  In the first plot (left), we use a minimal window
(default) sufficient to allow for at least 3 (order + 1) samples per resampling
point.  This produces a rather jagged plot that represents the data on a small
local scale.  Please note that this is only recommended when we know the sample
spacing is regular since the default window is taken from stochastic analysis
of the sample distribution.

In the second plot, a fit is generated using a much wider window
(:math:`\pi / 2 \approx 25 \text{ samples}`) and a distance weighting
parameter of 0.4 (:math:`\alpha = 0.4`) which is more representative of the
true sine function.

    :include-source:

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from grig.resample import Resample

    rand = np.random.RandomState(100)
    noise = rand.rand(100) - 0.5
    x = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 100)
    ytrue = np.sin(x)
    y = ytrue + noise
    xout = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 1000)

    narrow_resampler = Resample(x, y, order=2)
    yfit = narrow_resampler(xout)
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.subplot(121)
    plt.plot(x, y, '.', label='Samples')
    plt.plot(xout, yfit, label='Fit')
    plt.plot(x, ytrue, '--', label='Truth')
    plt.legend()
    plt.title("Fit using minimal window")

    wide_resampler = Resample(x, y, window=np.pi / 2, order=2)
    yfit2 = wide_resampler(xout, smoothing=0.4, relative_smooth=True)
    plt.subplot(122)
    plt.plot(x, y, '.', label='Samples')
    plt.plot(xout, yfit2, label='Fit')
    plt.plot(x, ytrue, '--', label='Truth')
    plt.legend()
    plt.title("Fit using wide window with distance weighting")
    plt.show()


Multiple data-sets
==================
If you wish to perform resampling multiple times from a fixed set of input
coordinates to a fixed set of output coordinates with different data, error,
or mask values then it is preferable to do this with a single :class:`Resample`
object than creating multiple instances.  In this case, all data should be
supplied on initialization.

The following example does this to correct a corrupted RGB image, where each
R-G-B slice represents a different data set that shares input and output
coordinate mappings with all other sets.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    from grig.resample import Resample
    import imageio
    import numpy as np

    image = imageio.imread('imageio:chelsea.png').astype(float)
    s = image.shape
    rand = np.random.RandomState(42)
    bad_pix = rand.rand(*s) < 0.7  # 70 percent corruption
    bad_image = image.copy()
    bad_image[bad_pix] = np.nan

    y, x = np.mgrid[:s[0], :s[1]]
    coordinates = np.vstack([c.ravel() for c in [x, y]])

    yout = np.arange(s[0])
    xout = np.arange(s[1])

    # supply data in the form (nsets, ndata)
    data = np.empty((s[2], s[0] * s[1]), dtype=float)
    for frame in range(s[2]):
        data[frame] = bad_image[:, :, frame].ravel()

    resampler = Resample(coordinates, data, window=10, order=2)
    good = resampler(xout, yout, smoothing=0.1, relative_smooth=True,
                     order_algorithm='extrapolate', jobs=-1)

    # get it b1ack into the correct shape and RGB format for plotting
    good = np.clip(np.moveaxis(good, 0, -1).astype(int), 0, 255)

    # Use the original good pixel coordinates where available
    good[~bad_pix] = bad_image[~bad_pix]

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.subplot(1,2,1)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.imshow(bad_image / 255)
    plt.title("Corrupted image (70% NaN)")

    plt.subplot(1,2,2)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.imshow(good)
    plt.title("Reconstructed image")
    plt.show()


.. _edge_clipping_example:

Order limits and edge clipping
==============================

The following example uses a 3rd order polynomial to resample an image
(top-left) onto a finer resolution grid.  The top-right image was generated
using the default edge mode `'com_distance'` which
only permits resampling if enough samples bound a resampling point in both the
x and y directions.  This is the safest option but does result a NaN border.
The bottom-left image uses `order_algorithm='extrapolate'` to permit resampling
regardless of the sample distribution so long as enough unique samples exist to perform
fitting.  Finally, the bottom-right image uses the "com_distance" edge mode
to only perform fits if the samples are within a
certain threshold from the coordinate center-of-mass of samples within the
window.

Note that an optimal window selection is performed by the resampler since
the samples (pixels in this case) are regularly spaced and the `window`
parameter was omitted during initialization.  A small `smoothing` parameter
has been used to preserve detail.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    from grig.resample import Resample

    y, x = np.mgrid[:image.shape[0], :image.shape[1]]
    coordinates = np.vstack([c.ravel() for c in [x, y]])

    # default resampler
    resampler = Resample(coordinates, image.ravel(), order=3)

    # blow up by a factor of 5
    xout = np.linspace(0, 63, 64 * 5)
    yout = np.linspace(0, 63, 64 * 5)

    # Default uses "bounded" order algorithm
    bounded_mode = resampler(xout, yout, smoothing=0.05,
                             relative_smooth=True, order_algorithm='bounded',

.. _adaptive_weighting_example:

Adaptive Weighting
==================

The following images and associated weighting maps are generated using the same
second order polynomial resampler from a coarse input image (not displayed).
The output images are at 3 times the original resolution.  A naive
approximation to the error and spatial scale was used.  The original image
was originally had data values in the range [0, 255] scaled into the range
[0, 1].  The error was taken to be equal to 1 in the original image which
is :math:`\approx` 0.003 in the scaled image.

Likewise, the spatial scale was taken to be 3 pixels (each dimension) by eye.
It is suggested to use a window region of :math:`\approx` 3 times this value
when using adaptive weighting.  Therefore, the window in each dimension is 9
pixels.  Since this is a regular grid of samples, the `adaptive_threshold`
parameter (limit to the minimum contraction of the window) has been set to
:math:`\frac{1}{3}` so there are always at least 3 samples to fit in both
dimensions for a second order polynomial (requires `order` + 1).

The left-most images display the result and associated weight map using these
parameters without adaptive weighting.  Note however, that `smoothing=1/3`
conveys a different meaning depending on whether adaptive weighting is enabled
or not.  The middle image and weight
map were generated using a very fine resolution weighting parameter of 0.01
resulting in something very close to the original image.  Here, pixel-to-pixel
noise variation can clearly be seen.

Finally, the right-most image and weight map were created using the adaptive
weighting algorithm.  Pixel-to-pixel noise variation can no longer be seen
while details are preserved.  Examining the adaptive weight map generally
shows which areas are smoother (high weight) and which areas preserve more
of the details (low weight).
